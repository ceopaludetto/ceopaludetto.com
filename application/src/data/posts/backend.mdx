Authoring a backend in TypeScript can become a daunting task if you don't know where to start. But my stack of choice has the absolute DX that I need to be productive.

The stack I use is:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) (with [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/))
- [Mercurius](https://mercurius.dev/)
- [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)

## Why Bun?

Bun has one of the best DX that a runtime can offer. It's fast, easy to use, and support TypeScript out of the box.

## Why NestJS?

NestJS is a framework that incorporates the best practices of Node.js. It's a great choice for building scalable and maintainable applications.

`test`

```ts twoslash
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'

@Module({})
class ApplicationModule {}

class SomeInsanelyHugeDeepClassNamedaoekdpoakedopkaeodkaoekdpaoekdopakeopdkapoedkpaoekdpoakeopdokaed{}
```
